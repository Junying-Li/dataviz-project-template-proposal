# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the global Earthquake dataset in 1900-1999. 

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a bar plot and it shows the deaths in earthquakes of different regions.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * (insert your question or task here) How does the X vary over time?
 * (insert your question or task here) Is there any correlation between X and Y?
 * (insert your question or task here) Are there interesting spatial patterns in X?
 * (insert your question or task here) How many X are there across different Y?

## Sketches

[![image](project-sketch.png)

The sketch contains 3 linked visualizations, which are a bar plot, a world map, and a timescale. 

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)
